# Search Redefined

Imagine if we can change search as we know it!

This is the age of information. The widespread use of social media has lead to a constant stream of real time data.
What if search relevance can now be seen from a real time domain and then add multiple layers to it like location, interests, scope and so on? Can this lead to a new experience to the user?

This is what we seek to find and determine in this project.

Our motivation comes from the simple statement that "Time is relative"
