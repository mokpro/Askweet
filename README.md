# Project
A 2015 CS 410 - Text Information System project

Twitter promotes high interactions among users. 500 million tweets are produced per day and roughly 10% of these are questions tweeted by users.

In this project we aim to identify such tweets. We focus on
- Classifying tweets into a question and non-question.
- Classifying question tweets into machine-answerable or not. 

Towards this end we implemented a technique that involved data gathering, feature extraction, feature selection and training classifiers.
