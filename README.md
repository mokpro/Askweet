# Project
A 2015 CS 410 - Text Information System project

Twitter promotes high interactions among users. 500 million tweets are produced per day and roughly 10% of these are questions tweeted by users.

In this project we aim to identify such tweets. We focus on
- Classifying tweets into a question and non-question.
- Classifying question tweets into machine-answerable or not. 

#Technique 

Towards this end we implemented a technique that involvs 4 steps

- Data gathering
- Feature extraction
- Feature selection 
- Training classifiers

Our results have been encouraging so far.
